With Adobe Aero, users can import assets created in Adobe Creative Cloud apps like Photoshop and Illustrator, as well as 3D models from Adobe Dimension or third-party sources. These assets can then be arranged and animated within the Aero interface to build immersive AR scenes.

One of the key features of Adobe Aero is its intuitive interface, which allows users to easily place objects in real-world environments using the device's camera. This makes it ideal for creating AR experiences for a variety of purposes, including marketing campaigns, educational content, and interactive storytelling.

Adobe Aero also supports collaboration, allowing multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously using cloud syncing. This makes it easier for teams to collaborate on AR projects and share their work with others.
